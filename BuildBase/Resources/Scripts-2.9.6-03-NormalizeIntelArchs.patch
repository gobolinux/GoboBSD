This normalizes architectures i386, i486, i586 to i686
(which represent all 32-bit x86 processors) and amd64 to x86_64
(which represents all 64-bit x86 processors).

Rationale:
If we (at some point in the future) want to support common patches
for 32/64-bits x86 processors, across all kerneltypes, they need
to agree on the architecture.

This patch will only affect i386.Darwin and i386.FreeBSD, both which
have ~3-4 recipes in the repository at the time this patch was created
(those few recipes will need to be updated to use i686.Darwin and
i686.FreeBSD)

The patch also fixes identation in Get_Architecture function
